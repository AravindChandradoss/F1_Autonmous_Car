# F1_Autonmous_Car
ROS, LIDAR, Hector SLAM, Nvidia JetsonTK1 :: The Objective is to control a mini-F1 car using LIDAR. 

Refer [F1/10th](https://fiorentini-mslab.engineering.osu.edu/ms-projects/f110-autonomous-racing)

The objective of the project is to drive a mini F1 car autonomously in a benchmark path with obstacles. 

In short,
-SLAM map is generated using Hector mapping with LIDAR data (Hokuyo).
-Control Algorithm was developed to drive the car. Here, the controller works as a middle level control. 
 
 TO-DO: 
 -High level control has to developed (i.e. Path planning using SLAM map). 

We are still working on it. I will update once it is completed.
